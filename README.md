# Macroeconomics-PhD
This repository contains the files for assignments I performed for a PhD-level Macroeconomics course. The assignment specifics are created by the course professor. The repository includes the following files:

1. **growth_model_Q.pdf**: This file contains the specifics of one sector growth model that is being solved using the dynamic programming method (see 2).
2. **growth_model_code.ipynb**: It is a jupyter notebook file that performs value function iteration for growth model in 1.
3. **uncertainty_growth_model_Q.pdf**: This file contains the specifics of stochastic growth model that is solved using dynamic programming (see 4).
4. **uncertainty_growth_model_code.ipynb**: It is a jupyter notebook file that solves 3. using value function iteration method.
5. **uncertainty_growth_model_report.pdf**: It is a homework submission file for 3.
